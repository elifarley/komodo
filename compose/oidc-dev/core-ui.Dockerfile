# Branch UI served by the digest-pinned core image (spec §6.3).
# Stage 1 mirrors ui/Dockerfile's builder stage; stage 2 is production core.
# CORE_IMAGE must be a full ref with digest; it is set in
# compose/oidc-dev/.env (gitignored) — see README step 1. If this ARG is
# empty, the --env-file was forgotten: `FROM ${CORE_IMAGE}` below fails.
